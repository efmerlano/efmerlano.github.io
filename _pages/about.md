<br>

Hi there! I'm a microeconomist currently based at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, econometrics, and social data science. Some of the fields I have worked on involve labor economics, crime and conflicts, education, and health economics.

Before moving to the UK, I was a senior advisor at the Ministry of Education (Colombia) and researcher at [URosario](https://www.urosario.edu.co/inicio/) (Colombia). 

I am a Ph.D. (c) in Economics at [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). I also obtained an M.Res. (with Distinction) in Economics at [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk), and an M.A. and B.A. in Economics at [URosario](https://www.urosario.edu.co/Facultad-de-Economia/Inicio/).

Feel free to contact me at <efmerlano@gmail.com> or add me on any of my social media. I tend to use Instagram ([here](https://www.instagram.com/e_felipe_ml/)) and I'm slowly working on my tweeting skills ([here](https://twitter.com/efmerlano)).
