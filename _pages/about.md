<br>

Hi there! I'm a microeconomist currently based at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

My research interests are in applied econometrics and social data science. Some of the fields I have worked on involve labor economics, crime and conflicts, education, and health economics.

Before moving to the UK, I was a senior advisor at the Ministry of Education (Colombia) and a researcher at [Universidad del Rosario](https://www.urosario.edu.co/inicio/) (Colombia). I am a PhD (c) in economics at QMUL, and I previously obtained a Master of Research in Economics (QMUL), Master of Arts in Economics (URosario), and BA in Economics (URosario).

Feel free to add me on any of my social media (I tend to use [Instagram: e_felipe_ml](https://www.instagram.com/e_felipe_ml/) and [Facebook: efmerlano](https://www.facebook.com/efmerlano/)).
