<br>

Hi there! I'm a microeconomist based at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

My research interests are in applied econometrics and data science. Some of the fields I have worked on involve labor economics, crime and conflicts, education and health economics.

Before moving to the UK, I was a senior advisor at the Ministry of Education (Colombia) and a researcher at [Universidad del Rosario](https://www.urosario.edu.co/inicio/) (Colombia). I am a PhD (c) in economics at QMUL, and I previously obtained a Master of Research [MRes] in Economics (QMUL), Master of Arts [MA] in economics (URosario), and Bachelor of Arts [BA] in economics (URosario).
