<br>

Hi there! I am an applied microeconomist currently based at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)</a>.

My research interests involve a combination of applied microeconomics, econometrics, and social data science. My recent experience focuses on causal inference methods (multidimensional regression-discontinuity design) and discrete choice models when decision-makers have incorrect beliefs or face a limited set of alternatives. I also have research experience in labor economics, education and health economics in both developed and developing economies.

Before moving to London, I was a senior advisor working on policy evaluation at the Ministry of Education (Colombia) and a researcher at <a href="https://www.urosario.edu.co/" target="_blank">URosario</a> (Colombia).

I have PhD in Economics from <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London</a>. I also obtained an M.Res. (with Distinction) in Economics at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">QMUL</a>, and an M.A. and B.A. in Economics at <a href="https://www.urosario.edu.co/" target="_blank">URosario</a>.

Feel free to contact me at efmerlano [at] gmail.com or add me on any of my social media. I tend to use Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/efmerlano/" target="_blank">(here)</a>, and I'm slowly working on my Twitter (X) skills <a href="https://twitter.com/efmerlano/" target="_blank">(here)</a>.
